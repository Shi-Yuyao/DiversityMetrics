"""
Evaluation scripts for BLEU, ROUGE, CIDEr-D, and METEOR, adapted from the MSCOCO
Caption Evaluation Code (https://github.com/tylin/coco-caption)

The input and output data formats are simplified compared to the reference
implementation.

Reference and Candidate input formats:
    List of dict {image_id: "$image_name", caption: "$caption"}

    where $image_name and $caption are strings

In case of multiple sentences for the same image, each sentence needs to be spec-
ified in the above format (along with the image_id).

Configuration for the evaluation code can be specified in params.json. Generally,
you would want to specify the path to your data, name of the reference file, name
of the candidate file (as per the above format) and the source to use for IDF,
either using the reference corpus or using some precomputed values from MSCOCO
Validation Set.

NOTE: The number of images in the reference and candidate datasets should be the
same. The code will throw an error otherwise.
